Virtual DOM:
  Virtual DOM is the representation of actiual DOM (Which we keep in our code)
Node:
 Node is the actual individual element in the virtual DOM
Tree:
 Is the collection of Nodes ( Virtual Representation of DOM)

Reconciliation:
  Reconciliation is the alogrithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which
  parts needs to be changed.

  Reconciliation is process that React uses to update virtual DOM and the actual DOM when
  the state of the component chnages. It compares the current virtual DOM with the new 
  virtual DOM that is created after a change, and determines the minimum number of changes
  that need to be made to the actual DOM to bring it inline with the new Virtual DOM tree.
