1. What is Emmet?


Async & Defer in Javascript

React.createElement --> return a React Element (which is nothing but a object)
createElement(type, props, children)

React.createRoot(// need to pass the DOM node)

DocumentContentLoaded ==> event will trigger when after HTML document is completely parsed and all defered scripts are 
downloaded (fetcehd) & executed


Normal -->HTML Parsing ---> Script fetching, execution ----> HTML Parsing
Async --->HTML Parsing ---->
            Scripts laoding ----> executing scripts --->HTML Parsing

Defer --->HTML Parsing ----> 
            Scripts laoding ----->HTML Parsing ---> Script  Executing
